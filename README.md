# OpenAI Realtime Conversation for Home Assistant

A Home Assistant custom component that integrates with OpenAI's Realtime API for real-time voice and text conversations, with MCP (Model Context Protocol) server support.

## Features

- **Real-time Conversations**: Uses OpenAI's Realtime API with WebSocket for low-latency responses
- **Native Speech-to-Speech**: Direct audio processing without separate STT/TTS pipeline
- **Voice Support**: Native speech-to-speech capabilities with configurable voices
- **MCP Server Integration**: Connect to external MCP servers for extended tool capabilities
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Built-in tools for controlling smart home devices
- **Conversation Agent**: Works as a Home Assistant conversation agent
- **Media Player Entity**: Control audio input/output directly
- **Binary Sensors**: Monitor connection, listening, speaking, and processing states
- **Custom STT/TTS Providers**: Use Realtime API for speech recognition and synthesis

## Architecture

Unlike the default Home Assistant voice pipeline (STT → AI → TTS), this integration uses OpenAI's Realtime API which handles **speech-to-speech directly**:

```

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.1.0 or later
- OpenAI API key with access to the Realtime API
- Python 3.11 or later

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant
2. Click on "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL
6. Install "OpenAI Realtime Conversation"
7. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `custom_components/openai_realtime` folder
2. Copy it to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**
2. Search for "OpenAI Realtime"

   - **Instructions**: Custom system instructions
   - **Temperature**: Response creativity (0.0 - 2.0)
   - **Max Output Tokens**: Maximum response length
5. Optionally add MCP servers for extended functionality

## MCP Server Configuration

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers allow you to extend the AI's capabilities with external tools.

To add an MCP server:
1. During setup or in options, provide:
   - **Server Name**: A unique identifier for the server
   - **Server URL**: The HTTP/HTTPS endpoint of the MCP server
   - **Token** (optional): Authentication token if required

### Example MCP Server Setup

```yaml
# Example MCP server configuration
name: my_mcp_server
url: https://my-mcp-server.example.com/mcp
token: your-auth-token
```

### Using Home Assistant's Built-in MCP Server (Recommended)

Home Assistant has a built-in MCP Server integration that exposes all your entities and services to MCP clients. This is the easiest way to give the AI full access to your smart home.

#### Step 1: Enable the MCP Server Integration

1. Add to your `configuration.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   mcp_server:
   ```

2. Restart Home Assistant

3. The MCP server will be available at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8123/api/mcp
   ```
   Or if using HTTPS:
   ```
   https://localhost:8123/api/mcp
   ```

For more details, see the [Home Assistant MCP Server documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mcp_server/).

#### Step 2: Configure OpenAI Realtime to Use It

When setting up or configuring the OpenAI Realtime integration:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **OpenAI Realtime** → **Configure**
2. Add MCP Server with:
   - **Name**: `homeassistant` (or any name you prefer)
   - **URL**: `http://localhost:8123/api/mcp`
   - **Token**: Create a Long-Lived Access Token:
     1. Go to your profile (click your name in sidebar)
     2. Scroll to "Long-Lived Access Tokens"
     3. Click "Create Token"
     4. Copy the token and paste it here

#### Example Configuration

```yaml
# MCP Server settings in OpenAI Realtime integration
name: homeassistant
url: http://localhost:8123/api/mcp
token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...  # Your long-lived access token
```

#### What This Enables

With the HA MCP Server connected, the AI gains access to:
- All entity states and attributes
- All available services
- Area and device information
- Much more comprehensive control than the built-in tools alone

> **Note**: The built-in tools (`get_entity_state`, `call_service`, etc.) still work alongside MCP servers. MCP servers provide additional capabilities.

## Built-in Home Assistant Tools

The integration provides these built-in tools for controlling Home Assistant:

### get_entity_state
Get the current state of any Home Assistant entity.
```
"Turn on the living room light" → Checks light.living_room state
```

### call_service
Call any Home Assistant service.
```
"Set the thermostat to 72 degrees" → climate.set_temperature
```

### get_entities_by_domain
List all entities in a domain.
```
"What lights do I have?" → Lists all light entities
```

### get_area_entities
Get all entities in a specific area.
```
"What devices are in the bedroom?" → Lists entities in bedroom area
```

## Usage

### As Conversation Agent

1. Go to **Settings** → **Voice Assistants**
2. Create a new assistant or edit an existing one
3. Select "OpenAI Realtime" as the conversation agent
4. Use with any voice input method (Assist, voice satellites, etc.)

### Using the Media Player

The integration creates a media player entity for direct audio control:

- **Play**: Start listening for audio input

## Lovelace Card (Browser Microphone)

This integration includes a custom Lovelace card that captures audio directly from your browser's microphone and streams it to the OpenAI Realtime API.

### Step 1: Add Lovelace Resource

The integration tries to register the card automatically, but you may need to add it manually:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards** → **⋮ (three dots)** → **Resources**
2. Click **Add Resource**
3. Enter:
   - **URL**: `/openai_realtime/openai-realtime-card.js?v=(random_int_for_debug/update)`
   - **Resource type**: JavaScript Module
4. Click **Create**

Alternatively, add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
lovelace:
  resources:
    - url: /openai_realtime/openai-realtime-card.js
      type: module
```

### Step 2: Add the Card to Dashboard

> **Note**: This card does not support the visual editor. When you see the error "Visual editor is not supported" or `setConfig is not a function`, use the YAML editor instead.

#### Using YAML Editor

1. Go to your dashboard and click **Edit** (pencil icon)
2. Click **+ Add Card**
3. Scroll down and select **Manual** (or click the three dots and choose "Edit in YAML")
4. Paste the following configuration:

```yaml
type: custom:openai-realtime-card
title: OpenAI Realtime Voice
show_transcript: true
show_waveform: true
mute_while_speaking: true
```

5. Click **Save**

#### Editing an Existing Card

If you need to edit the card later:
1. Click the three dots (⋮) on the card
2. Select **Edit** 
3. If you see "Visual editor is not supported", click **Edit in YAML**
4. Make your changes and save

### Card Features

    custom_components.openai_realtime: debug
```

Then restart Home Assistant.

### Key Log Messages to Look For

| Log Message | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `Connected to OpenAI Realtime API` | WebSocket connected successfully |
| `Session created: sess_XXX` | Session established with OpenAI |
| `Updating session with X tools` | Tools are being registered |
| `Session updated` | Tools registered successfully ✅ |
| `API Error: ...` | Something went wrong ❌ |
| `Function call received` | AI is calling a Home Assistant tool |
| `Function result sent to OpenAI` | Tool execution completed |
| `Registering event handlers including function_call handler` | WebSocket API handlers set up |

### Common Issues

#### API Error: Invalid type for 'session.max_response_output_tokens'
This was a known issue where the token value was sent as a decimal. Update to the latest version.

#### Tools not working / AI says it did something but nothing happened
1. Check logs for `API Error` messages after `Updating session with X tools`
2. Look for `Session updated` - if missing, session config failed and tools weren't registered
3. Verify entity IDs exist in Home Assistant
4. Check for `Function call received` in logs to confirm AI is trying to call tools

#### No audio playback
- Ensure your browser allows audio playback
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)
- Try refreshing the page with Ctrl+Shift+R

#### Microphone not working
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for microphone access)
- Check browser permissions for microphone access
- Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

#### "Not connected to OpenAI Realtime API"
- Check your API key is valid
- Ensure you have access to the Realtime API (not all accounts have it)
- Check your internet connection

#### Audio playing multiple times / overlapping
- This was fixed in recent versions - update to latest
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Browser Console Debugging

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for messages:
   - `Subscribing to OpenAI Realtime events...` - Card is connecting
   - `Subscribed successfully` - Connection established
   - `Received event:` - Events coming from backend
   - `Playing audio chunk` - Audio is being played

### Check Integration Status

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Find "OpenAI Realtime"
3. Check if it shows any errors

### View Full Logs

```bash
# In Home Assistant terminal or SSH
tail -f /config/home-assistant.log | grep openai_realtime
```

### Test API Connection

Try sending a text message via Developer Tools → Services:
```yaml
service: openai_realtime.send_message
data:
  message: "Hello, can you hear me?"
```
